Child Benefit tax calculator
===========

This calculator reports how much child benefit tax you are entitled during a tax year.

There is a cut-off date of 7 January 2013. This is the date [High Income Child Benefit Tax Charge](https://www.gov.uk/child-benefit-tax-charge/overview) came in effect.
This means that if the 2012 tax year is selected the calculator will only calculate the child benefit you are entitled to from 7 Jan 2013 to 5 Apr 2013, not for the entire tax year.
